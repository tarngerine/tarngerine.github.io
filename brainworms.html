    <h1>Julius Tarng — Brainworms</h1>
    <p>Why be productive? Can you refuse productivity? How does the framing of side projects change when we assume life beyond capitalism and full time jobs</p>

<p>How do you truly accept yourself? When you&#39;re comprised of all the &quot;Shoulds&quot; that others around you have imprinted on you. How do you pick and choose as an adult which ones to abandon, which ones to keep, which new ones to adopt? The appeal of people feeling &quot;put together&quot; online, even in more &quot;raw&quot; spaces like Twitter is a trap — even the most &quot;famous&quot; people on Twitter are human, questioning their own definitions of success. How do you shut off that voice saying &quot;you&#39;re not doing enough&quot; or &quot;you can be even richer/smarter this way&quot;?</p>

<p>What is success? A life of interest, maximizing flow, strong relationships</p>

<p>Does being &quot;happy&quot; === being able to sit silently with your brain all day? I seem to stress out when I&#39;m driving, sitting with nothing to do, spiral quite a bit. This urgency in me — where does it come from? Urge to display productivity?</p>
