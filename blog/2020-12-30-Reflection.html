    <h1>Reflection 2020</h1>
    <p>It&#39;s pretty wild to think that at the beginning of this year I was in a toxic relationship with my job. I had a big falling out with one of the people I deeply respected in leadership over the holidays, and it was apparent to me that while we agreed on many humanity-level morals (something I screened for when applying for a job post-Facebook), the day-to-day values were wildly misaligned (from how important transparency is, to how product strategy should be formed).</p>

<p>Throughout that job I had been working with a therapist, and the majority of our work is on positive psychology. Some of the big lessons we focused on were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accepting things I cannot control</li>
<li>Realizing that I have control over how I view things (positively vs negatively), and how to act on that choice</li>
<li>Identifying my top personal values to guide any decisions I needed to make in the future</li>
<li>More recently, identifying and combatting low self-esteem</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the things we discussed was how important work actually is to me. There&#39;s a lot of anti-work discourse, and a lot of folks who ended up in tech realizing and discussing how much they dislike tech. That&#39;s not me — I genuinely love technology. I grew up around computers, and this is my &quot;dream&quot; industry. I love everything about software. However, social pressure and low self-esteem led me to be swept along this discourse, hating a thing I really liked. Once I was able to identify this friction, it eased a lot of my turmoil.</p>

<p>I ended up taking the leap to go freelance in order to prioritze this part of me, and I wrote a few months after that about the <a href="2020-09-08-Praxis.html">state of remote &quot;praxis&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>Last time I wrote, I identified this tight feeling in my chest. As of a month or two ago, it&#39;s mostly disappeared. I&#39;m not entirely sure why. It could be that I secured a solid rate from my client, and work for that client really picked up. The days when I have it again are usually the empty days — the days I&#39;m supposed to take off. And this is where the discourse around work-life-balance starts to cause friction in me again.</p>

<p>I accept that many folks have an unhealthy relationship with work. I am also a victim to hustle culture (identifying when this flares up and stopping it is still a challenge, takes a few days). However, one of my main personal values is the love of learning. The reason I like to think about my current client&#39;s project is how much I&#39;m learning from it. I&#39;m a tech lead, and there are so many engineering concepts and low level details to think about!</p>

<p>So for now, it seems I&#39;ve found a good balance. Work is interesting, I&#39;m making more progress in how I react to my surroundings, and currently tackling self esteem.</p>

<p>Looking ahead to 2021, I&#39;ve been talking with potential accountants to discuss how to structure my business. A big thing I had to work through while we discussed filing as an S Corp was the delineation between just &quot;selling my time&quot; as a freelancer, vs &quot;making a profit&quot; as a business-owner (specifically, the benefit of an S Corp is paying yourself a salary that&#39;s lower than your total intake — how do you argue the difference between a reasonable salary and what you take as a distribution?). This discussion was a difficult one for me to have, not only with the CPAs, but with myself. I have such a gut-level reaction to the idea of making profit and capitalism (again due to much of the anti-capitalism discourse I read), that I was really uncomfortable with this shift in thinking. However, I&#39;ve since come around, thanks to a conversation with my partner, to a more positive way to think about it. If I&#39;m able to subcontract some of the work to an apprentice, and contribute value through guidance and mentorship, the idea of making profit would satisfy the-very-not-black-and-white interpretation of a business (i.e. S Corp filing) and still feels in line with my personal ethics (love of learning often comes with love of sharing those learnings).</p>

<p>I also have a potentially exciting partnership with a friend, and I&#39;m super excited to do occasional team ups / collaborations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m currently awaiting confirmation that the business name I chose is available — super exciting. I hope it is! </p>

<p>Given my recent work as a tech lead, I&#39;m also considering a reframe of my role from an independent product designer to an &quot;independent software creative&quot;. Creative technologist and design engineer are the closest roles but neither feel quite right. Many Creative Technologists I know work in advertisement, and Design Engineering still feels very murky to me — is it design or engineering? It also feels much less experimental than I want to feel. Being a software creative focuses on the fact that I&#39;m working in software, with a focus on creativity.</p>

<p>A lot of this is driven by my current experience with MakeSpace. It&#39;s been a wild past 3 months, working on the 2nd version of the prototype. I&#39;m leading a few contractors and building a performant, multiplayer web application from scratch. I&#39;ve learned so much about React and Javascript (due to closures), as well as WebGL, CRDT-like data structures, WebRTC... it&#39;s incredibly rare to be in this position of having so much to learn. I won&#39;t lie, there are still ups and downs — bugs are infinitely more difficult to resolve in a multiplayer environment, and performance... I&#39;m very excited to get better at that :p</p>

<p>I&#39;m excited for 2021! </p>
